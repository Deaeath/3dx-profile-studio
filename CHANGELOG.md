# Changelog

## 1.2.1 - 2026-10-08

### AI on your selection
- Select any text and an **Ask AI** button appears next to it. Type what you want ("make it rhyme") or pick
  Improve, Shorter, Longer, Fix spelling, Funnier, Flirtier, Classier, Add symbols, Recolour or Translate.
  Only the selection changes.
- On an empty line, **Write here with AI** writes something new at that spot: an intro line, a hobbies
  section, a divider, a closing line or whatever you describe. It matches the look of the text around it.
- **Ctrl+J** opens the same bar anywhere, and it's in the right-click menu and on the AI tab.
- The **Assistant** now changes only your selection when you have one (it says so, with a button to use
  the whole text instead), and the selection stays highlighted while you type to it.

### Templates are easier to find
- A **Templates** button in the top bar opens the full gallery.
- The Templates tab now shows a scrolling strip with samples from every category, labelled, plus
  the total count. The Home tab's Templates button opens the gallery directly.
- An empty card offers **Pick a template** and **Write it with AI**.

### Fixes
- Ordinary characters such as `|`, `+`, `<`, `=` and `~` were flagged as symbols that might not show in the game.
- AI answers no longer sometimes include several drafts or notes.
- Shorten on a selection now actually shortens it when the whole text is already under the limit.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-10-08

### Word-style editing
- Styles gallery (Title, Heading, Subheading, Normal, Quote, Small print). Enter after a heading goes back to Normal.
- Bulleted and numbered lists that continue when you press Enter; Tab and Shift+Tab indent and outdent.
- Center and right alignment, measured in the game font and done with spaces.
- Change case, format painter, find and replace, line tools (move, duplicate, delete), select all and a word count.
- Clipboard group and a right-click menu. Copy and paste keep formatting inside the Studio, and Ctrl+Shift+V pastes plain text.
- File tab: named documents saved in your browser (New, Open, Save, Save as, Rename, Delete), plus download and open of `.txt` files.
- View tab: hide the code panel, zoom presets and a keyboard shortcuts list.

### Templates
- 316 templates in 28 categories, with search, a gallery, your own saved templates, and AI-made templates
  from a description. Every template is tested against the game's limits.

### Deeper AI
- An Assistant panel: say what to change and it edits the card (Ctrl+K). Ctrl+Z undoes it.
- AI actions in the right-click menu, and one-click fixes in the checks: fit with AI, brighten dark text, proofread.

### Feedback
- A Feedback button for reporting a problem or suggesting an idea.

### Fixes
- Emptying the editor (select all, then delete) no longer leaves a hidden line break that cost 2 characters.
- The built-in Hearts gift template used ❤, which doesn't show in gifts; it now uses ♥.
- New checks flag symbols that don't show in gifts (with a one-click swap), symbols the game may not draw,
  and text too dark to read.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-10-07

### Free AI, no key needed
- The AI writer now works straight away: the new **Free AI (Claude)** option is the default, with no
  key or account. It runs on Claude Opus 5.5 through the Studio's own AI server, which keeps the key
  private, allows 10 requests a minute per person and stores nothing.
- Players who had picked a provider but never added a key are moved to the Free AI automatically.
  Anyone with their own key keeps using it, and every provider from 1.0.0 is still available.
- Pressing **Stop** cancels the request on the server too.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-04

The first public release.

### Editor
- A Word-style editor for 3DXChat profile and gift texts: a toolbar with bold, italic, colour, size, grow/shrink, clear formatting, undo and redo, and a card that looks like the game's profile panel.
- Gradients per letter or per word, with adjustable colour steps and a live cost estimate. Colours blend in OKLab.
- About 790 symbols in categories, 16 flags, dividers and eight fancy-letter styles.
- Profile and Gift modes with separate drafts and templates; `%username%` and a Mass gift maker.
- Import existing code, or paste code straight onto the card.

### Code
- Generates the shortest code it can: nesting ordered by how long each style lasts, colour names for red/white/blue/yellow/black, spaces merged into neighbouring colours.
- Counts like the game: 1000 characters for profiles, 240 characters and 255 bytes for gifts, line breaks count twice. Flags symbols that don't show in gifts.

### AI writer
- Write it for me, Shorten to fit, Fix spelling, Change tone, Translate and Style it, each previewed with its character count before you accept it.
- Works with a key from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Together AI, Perplexity or Cohere, or a local OpenAI-compatible server (Ollama, LM Studio). Requests go straight from the page to the provider.
